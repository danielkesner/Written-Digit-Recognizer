# Written-Digit-Classifier

I trained a neural network in Matlab to recognize handwritten numerical digits. The data used to train the neural network came from UCI's publically available Machine Learning Repository, an online resource hosting datasets for public use. More specific information on the dataset can be found at the website linked below, and more specific information regarding a sample workflow pattern can be found in Sample_Workflow.txt. I used Java to pre-process the image, and Matlab's neural network suite (nnstart and its variants) to train the neural network used to classify images.

The data used comes from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Semeion+Handwritten+Digit. The UCI page also contains a more in-depth explanation of the semeion.data dataset used to train the network. My thanks to Tactile Srl for making the data publically available.
